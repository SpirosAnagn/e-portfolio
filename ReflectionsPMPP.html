										<h1>PMPP module Reflections</h1>
									</header>
<b>Introduction</b><br> 
<br>
<p>The Research Methods and Professional Practice module served as a paradigm and prologue to the final thesis.<br>
   The whole module's duration was 12 weeks, which was initially thought to be sufficient to deliver the required assignments while keeping up with the reading material and lecturecasts.<br>
   Notwithstanding, it turned out to be a very challenging period, with the two primary deliverables requiring significantly more effort than initially anticipated.<br>
   Aside from the assignments, several research subjects and approaches were studied, which benefited personal improvement and generated transferable knowledge for the upcoming dissertation project.<br>
   The primary module's reflections are summarised as follows:<br>
</p>
																													
<b>Research Ethics</b><br> 
<br>
<p>Research ethics topic is a subject that is frequently overlooked or, in many cases, not perceived as a significant element.<br>
   This Unit allowed me to consider the researcher's perspective, which may explain why such concerns have never been personally investigated before from the reader's standpoint. Having studied many research papers during this MSc, 
   it was the first time that aspects of ethical issues were pointed out as a vital part and prerequisite for every research endeavour. <br>
   Integrity, transparency, and mutual benefit for both author and participant were among the Unit's focus and collaborative discussion topics as well. While adhering to the code of ethics is a priority, 
   the discussion I participated in noted that there are times when objectives conflict and the outcome should be viewed in relative rather than absolute terms.<br>
</p>

<b>Literature Review</b><br> 
<br>
<p>The primary goal of Unit 2 was to select a topic from a list and conduct a literature review.<br> 
   My first choice was "suspect profiling," which has been examined by various disciplines.<br> 
   The most challenging aspects were the large volume of the study material given the time constraints and the grouping procedure, 
   which assisted in organising the review effectively. Although the process first appeared chaotic and tiresome, 
   more intriguing issues and fresh ideas came out as time progressed.<br>
   The reading material and the tutor's guidance assisted me in gaining a firm grasp on how to deliver the review, 
   while some additional tools and websites also proved instrumental during this work.<br>
   For example, when looking for relevant information sources, the websites connectedpapers.com <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(visit site)</a>  
   and Scopus proved valuable partners.<a href="https://www.scopus.com"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(visit site)</a><br>
</p>

<b>Research Methods - Research Proposal</b><br> 
<br>
<p>Before this module, the various methodologies and research approaches had not been systematically and analytically considered. 
   While working on the Literature review assignment, I encountered a variety of strategies and techniques, 
   most of which were subsets of the two fundamental types of reasoning, deductive and inductive reasoning. 
   The second deliverable necessitated a more in-depth analysis of the various research approaches before settling on a research proposal. Exploratory or conclusive, qualitative, quantitative or hybrid? 
   These questions had to be addressed before creating the final proposal presentation while keeping the subject in view.<br>
   Although my proposal was only suggestive and was not intended to be my final capstone project, the design should have been as useful and efficient as if it had been an actual project, while my primary goal was to bridge the academic and business world gap.<br>
   My final proposal evolved from the initial "cybercrime profiling" to "Strategies and practices against internal cyber threats in Greek businesses." 
   The first part included a structured interview with cybersecurity experts from different industries, whereas the second would utilise the outcome from the first stage and set a poll/ survey among the participants, 
   trying to obtain broad agreement on the essential controls for preventing and detecting insider threats.<br>
   The module's reading material and the Unit's six lecturecast influenced my decision to conduct my research using questionnaires and interviews, 
   and given the subject's nature and target, I concluded with this method, a choice that seemed to have also been approved by my tutor.<br>
   During the development of the proposal, I was also introduced to some interesting tools that could enhance my actual project, namely, the Nvivo qualitative data analysis software <a href="https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo-qualitative-data-analysis-software/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(visit site)</a>  and the Otter.ai;  <a href="https://otter.ai/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(visit site)</a>  
   both seem promising and effective when conducting a qualitative survey.<br>
   Based on my experience with the proposal assignment, the newly discovered tools, and the instructions offered about the questionnaire and survey design, 
   a similar technique is likely to be used for my dissertation topic.<br>
</p>
										
<b>Research Validity, Generalisability and Reliability</b><br> 
<br>
<p>Another element of this module that I deem essential was my exposure to the three critical elements that every noteworthy research study should meet. 
   Recognising data bias (e.g., not a representative sample) or evaluating the reliability of a method in terms of the repeatability of its results is a fundamental skill not just for the author but also from the critical reader's standpoint. Evaluating my dissertation and the data acquired under the lenses of validity, generalisability, 
   and reliability is expected to increase the value and defence of my upcoming dissertation project.<br>
</p>										

<b>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</b><br>
<br>
<p>The module has provided me with an excellent opportunity to become familiar and refresh any prior experience with Statistics, 
   as well as to appreciate the discipline's critical role and contribution in practically every research or business project. 
   The most vital part was hypothesis testing, which constitutes a widespread technique used in a variety of studies in order to assess a case or an assumption based on quantified evidence.<br>
   Notwithstanding, due to the postgraduate nature of the programme, there was only a small part dedicated to Statistics and focused mainly on Inferential Statistics, skipping other topics like probabilities that were included only in the module's core book. 
   Given that I found the Statistics intriguing, I felt that additional material from an external source could be helpful. 
   Therefore, I opted for an Udemy class that was deemed very practical and easier to follow in order to get a firm grip on the fundamentals and complete the formative exercises. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/statistics-for-data-science-and-business-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(visit site)</a> 
</p>
										
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
<br>							
<p>Overall, the course was deemed one of the most demanding so far, and my decision to take it as a single module rather than double it with another was possibly the most important reason I met its requirements. 
   The first-hand experience I received from the assignments and the reading material is expected to have a substantial influence on my thesis and my career plans.
