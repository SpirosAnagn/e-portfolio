<b>Vulnerability – Threat – Risk</b><br> 
<br>
<p>Even though we use the terms threat, risk and vulnerability in our everyday lives in a more flexible and not so accurate way, as Information Security professionals, we have to understand the terminology and the content it describes in a more precise way. 
Hence, we can describe vulnerability as a weakness of a system or a technology, while the threat is the likelihood that this weakness could be exploited and harm our business.<br>
Finally, the risk is about the possible negative impact (loss) that an incident could have on our organization. (Although there are some different opinions)<br>
An interesting thing to remember is that the risk could never be eliminated, and the objective target is to keep it low to the degree that the company decides to accept it.</p>
																													
<b>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan</b><br> 
<br>
<p> Business Continuity has been a significant part of risk management for a long time, where organizations try to be prepared for large-scale incidents (earthquakes, floods, fire). <br>
Since data is a vital asset for almost every industry and due to the reliance on data for succeeding in their targets, it becomes apparent that business continuity has to incorporate also data recovery and protection strategies to defend against cybersecurity threats. <br> 
Having performed the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to evaluate the risks and the business impact, Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) must be set. In other words, objectives regarding the service downtime duration and the quantity of data loss that an organization can tolerate.<br>
Factors like budget, compliance requirements and resources must be considered through the designing and goal setting process. Reviewing and frequently assessing the disaster plan is also a critical factor that can differentiate between an effective and an inadequate plan. </p>

<b>TCP/IP – OSI Model</b><br>
<br>
<p>Examining communication functions from the TCP/IP or the OSI model perspective was a fascinating and valuable part of the module. Not only was this a vital networking part of understanding, but it also provides a thoroughgoing and efficient way to understand the different technologies and functions that take part.<br> 
Data flow between the different layers, the encapsulation and de-encapsulation process from the application level down to the physical layer (raw bits stream), constitutes a solid conceptual map that describes the interoperability between diverse communication systems and their protocols.<br>
Understanding layers' functions and protocols from a cybersecurity perspective is a valuable asset for every security professional. For example, when we face an SQL injection, we focus on layer 7 (Application), whereas we encounter a layer 3 (Network) problem in case of ICMP attack.
Despite the undeniable prevalence of the TCP/IP model, I found the OSI model more analytical and comprehensive in understanding the essential telecommunication functions.</p>

<b>Scanning task</b><br>
<br>
<p>Using Kali Linux and practising some fundamental penetration testing tools was the most intriguing part of the module. In order to deliver the assignment, we had to use a bunch of different tools, starting from basic network commands (PING, WHOIS, TRACEROUTE….) up to vulnerability scanners like OpenVas and Metasploit.<br>
Through this evolving process, additional sources like Tryhackme and further research had been a valuable ally in getting a more realistic view of the vulnerabilities and cybersecurity terms met so far only in the bibliography.<br>
For example, ICMP protocol before scanning with TRACEROUTE for revealing the whole route to reach the provided server was just a notion.<br>
After this basic command, it became more practical when there were cases between the hops that the result was blank (asterisks), pointing out that the ICMP protocol was disabled for some servers either from the ISP policy or from the company's security department.<br>
DoS attack was another interesting fact which took part. Using just a line of code to flood the targeted server from random IP requests had succeeded, making the server unreachable while the script was running. This paradigm pointed out the importance of security measures in a very comprehensive and convincing way.</p>

<b>Logging and Forensics</b><br>
<br>											
<p>Another captivating subject of the module was the introduction to digital forensics.
Although it seems an exciting sector (movies also enhance this point of view), it is a very demanding and vital part of cyber security, mainly when a breach case is transferred to a court.<br>
Meticulous and stringent handling is a prerequisite through the forensic stages of acquisition, investigation and reporting due to the digital forensics' field convergence with real-world crime investigation.<br>
Digital Forensics and Incident Response teams cooperate in evaluating the extension of the incident and the affected assets whilst simultaneously having to seek the appropriate mitigation measures in the shortest period possible.<br> 
Technical skills (i.e. Logging / Malware analysis, system and network understanding) combined with soft skills (i.e. criticality, analytical and communicational skills) are merely some of the most common competencies.<br>
Searching for evidence in order to identify the attacker is where the logging policy contributes the most. At the same time, the research's outcome is also vital to the company's security assessment along with the regulatory compliance.</p>
<br>												

<b>Security Standards (differences and similarities) </b><br>
<br>
<b>GDPR and PCI differences and overlaps:</b><br>
<br>							
<b>Differences</b><br>
<br>											
<ul>
<li>GDPR scope is mainly focused on personal data protection. It puts individuals in charge of their data by giving the appropriate tools to control it (consent, erasure or withdrawal).PCI's primary purpose is to secure cardholder's data from loss, theft and minimize damages from potential fraud or breaches. In other words, we could say that GDPR is more privacy-oriented whilst PCI is more security-oriented.</li>
<li>In the same fashion, GDPR set regulations for every possible data process and data storage, PCI on the other hand, regulates data relevant to the payment process.</li> 
<li>GDPR protects individuals from unauthorized data usage, while PCI limits and monitors access to card payment information.</li>
</ul>
<b>Overlaps</b><br>
<br>											
<ul>
<li>Since GDPR's magnitude is significantly broader than PCI, we can perceive PCI as a subset of GDPR. Given this point, we can find compliance regulations from PCI that could easily facilitate GDPR's scope.</li> 
<li>Both standards benefit from data and risk minimization where possible.
<li>Both standards benefit from regular staff training on security procedures and sensitive data handling.</li> 
<li>Breaches are perceived in the same way for both standards. A data breach in a cardholder's data also constitutes a GDPR breach.</li> 
<li>Article 25 of GDPR (Data protection by design and by default) suggests that appropriate technical and organizational measures should be implemented to ensure that the minimum data is kept and that only the authorized users can process the data. 
    This directive is also aligned with PCI's 10.6.1 requirement that mandates the daily logs supervisory (system logs, server logs, IPS logs, IDS logs)</li>
<li>Both standards dictate risk assessment to facilitate business decisions about risks that the organization faces. In particular, GDPR article 35 states that organizations should assess every possible risk that could affect every data process that takes part. This prerequisite is also presented in PCI requirement 12.2 (Implement a risk-assessment process).</li>
