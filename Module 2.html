<b>Information Security job roles</b><br> 
<br>
<p>The volume of knowledge and the diversity of the subjects that ISM embodies have 
shaped it to an intriguing and, in my opinion, elitist industry, where different competencies and skills are expected for the plethora of Information Security job roles.<br> 
Technical skills like networking, coding and system administration are undoubtedly critical for an Information Security professional. At the same time, people management and security standards in-depth understanding and implementation is also a challenging part.<br>   
Given that the human factor is a company's vital asset, soft skills and people management should never be overlooked from an information security perspective.<br>   
Diversity, versatility and fast evolution of the industry, on the other hand, make Information Security a vast field that is difficult to set a common framework and job's skillset in the long term.</p>

<b>TCP/IP – OSI Model</b><br>
<br>
<p>Examining communication functions from the TCP/IP or the OSI model perspective was a fascinating and valuable part of the module. Not only was this a vital networking part of understanding, but it also provides a thoroughgoing and efficient way to understand the different technologies and functions that take part.<br> 
Data flow between the different layers, the encapsulation and de-encapsulation process from the application level down to the physical layer (raw bits stream), constitutes a solid conceptual map that describes the interoperability between diverse communication systems and their protocols.<br>
Understanding layers' functions and protocols from a cybersecurity perspective is a valuable asset for every security professional. For example, when we face an SQL injection, we focus on layer 7 (Application), whereas we encounter a layer 3 (Network) problem in case of ICMP attack.
Despite the undeniable prevalence of the TCP/IP model, I found the OSI model more analytical and comprehensive in understanding the essential telecommunication functions.</p>

<b>Scanning task</b><br>
<br>
<p>Using Kali Linux and practising some fundamental penetration testing tools was the most intriguing part of the module. In order to deliver the assignment, we had to use a bunch of different tools, starting from basic network commands (PING, WHOIS, TRACEROUTE….) up to vulnerability scanners like OpenVas and Metasploit.<br>
Through this evolving process, additional sources like Tryhackme and further research had been a valuable ally in getting a more realistic view of the vulnerabilities and cybersecurity terms met so far only in the bibliography.<br>
For example, ICMP protocol before scanning with TRACEROUTE for revealing the whole route to reach the provided server was just a notion.<br>
After this basic command, it became more practical when there were cases between the hops that the result was blank (asterisks), pointing out that the ICMP protocol was disabled for some servers either from the ISP policy or from the company's security department.<br>
DoS attack was another interesting fact which took part. Using just a line of code to flood the targeted server from random IP requests had succeeded, making the server unreachable while the script was running. This paradigm pointed out the importance of security measures in a very comprehensive and convincing way.</p>


<b>Security Standards (differences and similarities) </b><br>
<br>
<b>GDPR and PCI differences and overlaps:</b><br>
<br>							
<b>Differences</b><br>
<br>											
<ul>
<li>GDPR scope is mainly focused on personal data protection. It puts individuals in charge of their data by giving the appropriate tools to control it (consent, erasure or withdrawal).PCI's primary purpose is to secure cardholder's data from loss, theft and minimize damages from potential fraud or breaches. In other words, we could say that GDPR is more privacy-oriented whilst PCI is more security-oriented.</li>
<li>In the same fashion, GDPR set regulations for every possible data process and data storage, PCI on the other hand, PCI regulates data relevant to the payment process.</li> 
<li>GDPR protects individuals from unauthorized data usage, while PCI limits and monitors access to payment information.</li>
</ul>
<b>Overlaps</b><br>
<br>											
<ul>
<li>Since GDPR's magnitude is significantly broader than PCI, we can perceive PCI as a subset of GDPR. Given this point, we can find compliance regulations from PCI that could easily facilitate GDPR's scope.</li> 
<li>Both standards benefit from data and risk minimization where possible.
<li>Both standards benefit from regular staff training on security procedures and sensitive data handling.</li> 
<li>Breaches are perceived in the same way for both standards. A data breach in a cardholder's data also constitutes a GDPR breach.</li> 
<li>Article 25 of GDPR (Data protection by design and by default) suggests that appropriate technical and organizational measures should be implemented to ensure that the minimum data is kept and that only the authorized users can process the data.</li> 
<li>This directive is also aligned with PCI's 10.6.1 requirement that mandates the daily logs supervisory (system logs, server logs, IPS logs, IDS logs)
<li>Both standards dictate risk assessment to facilitate business decisions about risks that the organization faces. In particular, GDPR article 35 states that organizations should assess every possible risk that could affect every data process that takes part. This prerequisite is also presented in PCI requirement 12.2 (Implement a risk-assessment process).</li>
