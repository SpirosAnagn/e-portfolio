												<h3>Why I chose Cyber Security?</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Switching a career at the age of 40s it is a tough decision, but I made it!
												Technology always fascinates me from a very young age. Although my career life and academic background have been focused on different paths,
												I firmly believe that it is high time I made a brand-new start to my entire life.
											    Having worked for over 12 years in our family business (a medium-sized company), starting from roles as Sales Specialist and IT Support,
												I worked my way up to more managerial positions as Production Director & President and BOD member.
											</p>
											<p> Throughout these years, I gained in-depth knowledge of running a business and making decisions for several critical issues.
											    Although I have no related experience in the pure Cyber Security sector, I possess a good understanding of networks, systems, and hardware.
											    The fact that security threats and vulnerabilities jeopardize our data and privacy led me to further examining Cyber Security topic.
											    My curiosity has been triggered, and I started looking into this through web platforms and speaking with professionals who work in the Information Security industry.
											    And that’s it; I made up my mind!
											   </p>
											 <p>In the question "How do you envisage your next career step after your MSc graduation?",
											    I share my thoughts and ideas below.<br>
											    I recognize that there is room for improvement in my case, so my priority is to excel in my security skill-set and expand my horizons through this MSc.<br>
											    At a later stage and after the successful completion of the course, I imagine myself working for a company and being a member of the Cyber Security team,
											    recognizing that the projects and the actual situations I will deal with will provide me with exciting, new and valuable experiences.<br>
											</p>
											 <p>The latter and the managerial expertise I have acquired to now will help me implement my long-term plan to set up my own Cyber Security company.
											    In my view, reskilling might be a must-have element for professionals to have and goes hand in hand with technology.
											    I stand here to embrace that change and embody it in my life.
